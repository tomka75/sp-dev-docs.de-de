<span data-ttu-id="7341f-p101">The **GetCell** and **GetCellA1** methods return the value of a single cell. If you try to request more than a single cellfor example, by passing in a range reference such as "B1:E2" or a named range that is larger than a single cell, and so onyour method call will fail. If you want to retrieve values from a range of cells, use the **GetRange** and **GetRangeA1** methods instead. Methods that have the A1 suffix ( **GetCellA1** and **GetRangeA1**) use a different coordinate system than those that do not ( **GetCell** and **GetRange**). If you want to use Excel-style references to cells, such as range references (for example, H8, A3:D5, Sheet2!A12:G18) or named ranges, you should use the methods with the A1 suffix. Those methods allow you to pass in the name of a sheet and the range address you want. In most cases, it is a good idea to use named ranges rather than Excel-style references, for abstraction reasons.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="7341f-p101">The **GetCell** and **GetCellA1** methods return the value of a single cell.

<span data-ttu-id="7341f-p102">If you want to access an Excel range by using a numeric coordinate system, you should use the methods that do not have the A1 suffix. It is easier to use range coordinates when you have code that iterates through a set of cells in a loop, or when the range coordinates are calculated dynamically as part of the algorithm.The row and column coordinates of a cell are 0-based. Therefore, "0,0" will return cell A1, as in this example:</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="7341f-p102">If you want to access an Excel range by using a numeric coordinate system, you should use the methods that do not have the A1 suffix.

```cs

// Call the GetCell method to retrieve a value from a cell.
// The cell is in the first row and first column; that is, cell A1
object[] rangeResult2 = xlservice.GetCell(sessionId, sheetName, 0, 0, true, out outStatus);

```

<span data-ttu-id="7341f-p103">If you are getting values from multiple adjacent cells, you may want to consider using the **GetRange** method instead of making multiple calls to the **GetCell** method. This results in a single roundtrip to the server instead of multiple roundtrips. Therefore, in some cases, you may gain a noticeable performance improvement by using the **GetRange** method instead of the **GetCell** method.When getting a range of cells using the **GetRange** and **GetRangeA1** methods, you get back an object array ( **object[]** in C# and **Object ()** in Visual Basic .NET). The object array is actually a jagged array. Each entry in the array you get back will be another array of objects representing the cells.
